## Declaring a vector
- General Form: Vector<type> v = new Vector();
- type needs to be a valid reference type
## Adding an element to a vector
- v.add(object of type);

- IM TESTING YOU
## Declaring an Array
- General Form: type[] arrayName;
- only creates a reference
- no array has actually been created yet

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];
- numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.
- Gotcha: Array size is not  modifiable once instantiated.
